            (nicknamed "Jay") is an artist dedicated to perfecting the craft of <br>
            storytelling. His non-traditional approach to songwriting, which brings <br>
            includes pulling inspiration from seemingly dissonant mediums, <br>
            allows him to create works of art for any audience. <br>

        Jorge's greatest inspirations come from video games and animation. <br>
        In his stories, he aims to emulate the addictive sense of progression <br>
        often seen in video games. He aims to write stories with larger than <br>
        life themes and characters. <br>

    <p>
        <b>His current project is the upcoming Odyssey-inspired musical EPIC.</b>
